# ADA Project - Team HotChocolate
#### Gabriel Benato, Auriane Debache, Xavier Nal and Joao Prado

## Introduction 

## Research Questions
  
## Proposed additional datasets

We propose an auxiliary dataset consisting of information about 72 beers sold at EPFL's bar, SAT. This datases is constructed by parsing the SAT menu, available here. For each beer, the following information is available: 

| Beer name | Price | Type | Brewery name | Origin | Available on tap? (True/False) | Available only seasonally? (True/False) | ABV | Serving volume |
|-----------|-------|------|--------------|--------|------------------|---------------------------|-----|----------------|

We use ```nltk```,```sklearn.feature_extraction``` and our own flavor of vector space retrieval to identify these beers in BeerAdvocate and RateBeer datasets. A full analysis is available in ```notebooks/SAT beers.ipynb```.

## Methods

## Proposed timeline

### Week 48 (28/12-2/12)

### Week 49 (5/12-9/12)

### Week 50 (12/12-16/12)

### Week 51 (19/12-23/12)

__Landmark__ : A brewtiful data analysis is live !

## Organization within the team:
